# TODO

- Chagne name of blockcount
- White space on bottom of current block number
- Cache full block data that comes in from ws and then grab that instead of the API call if possible in updateBlocks
- Need to pull blocks from window object rather than state because data is stale so it still thinks there is an empty array
- Try using websocket
- Clicking on account opens dialog or something
- Show account balance in account UI
- Show transaction count in account UI
- Open new dialog or similar for transaction data
- Just pass provider instead of full state
