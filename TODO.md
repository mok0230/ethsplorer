# TODO

- Cache full block data that comes in from ws and then grab that instead of the API call if possible in updateBlocks
- Clicking on account opens dialog or something
- Show account balance in account UI
- Show transaction count in account UI
- Open new dialog or similar for transaction data
- Just pass provider instead of full state
